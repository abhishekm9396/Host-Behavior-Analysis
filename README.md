--Introduction--

"Host-Behavior-Analysis" is a project focused on the analysis of property listings for a property rental company. 
The dataset provided has the information regarding the 2 cities in Canada, Greece, Italy, China and US each. The thorough analysis of the property listings is being done for the data and the meaningful insights have been provided, to comprehend how host behavior varies across a variety of metrics. Also extensive charts have been created to visualize the data in the best possible way.

--Goal & Methodology--

a. Analyzing different metrics to draw the distinction between Super Host and Other Hosts. To achieve this, following metrics are considered:

- Acceptance rate, 
- Response rate, 
- Instant booking,
- Profile picture, 
- Identity verified, 
- Review scores, 
- Average no. of bookings per month, etc.

b. Using the above analysis, identify the top 3 crucial metrics one needs to maintain to become a Super Host and also, find their average values.

c. Analyzing if Super Hosts tend to have large property types as compared to other Hosts.

d. Utilize data visualization techniques to present the findings and insights from the analysis. Visualizations help stakeholders understand the data intuitively and aid in decision-making.

1. The "response rate > avg response rate" chart demonstrates that around 90% of superhosts have a higher response rate than hosts, indicating that they are more responsive to user queries or problems.

2. Superhosts have a maximum of 512 listings, while hosts have 8,156 listings. However, 18% of superhosts have more listings (2) compared to 12% of hosts (3) when considering proportions.

3. Acceptance rate is a key factor that sets superhosts apart from hosts, as they have a higher rate of accepting booking requests.

4. Superhosts have a higher profile picture and identification rate compared to hosts.

5. Superhosts are more likely to accept instant bookings than regular hosts, Italy/Rome has the highest percentage of superhosts offering instant bookings at 12.57%, while Greece/Thessaloniki has the lowest percentage of hosts offering instant bookings at 0.91%.

6. In terms of positive comments, hosts have a slightly higher rate than superhosts. Superhosts need to focus more on providing better after-services. The average review score is good for both hosts and superhosts, with scores of 4.6 and 4.9 out of 5, respectively.

--Challeges Faced--
1. Handling and to deal with large data with excel and SQl was a challenging task.
2. Getting data well and consistent requires careful data cleaning and processing.
3. Diversification of Ideas.
